<p> Angular is a web framework that empowers developers to build fast, reliable applications.
Maintained by a dedicated team at Google, Angular provides a broad suite of tools, APIs, and libraries to simplify and streamline your development workflow. Angular gives you a solid platform on which to build fast, reliable applications that scale with both the size of your team and the size of your codebase.

Want to see some code? Jump over to our Essentials for a quick overview of what it's like to use Angular, or get started in the Tutorial if you prefer following step-by-step instructions.

Features that power your development
Keep your codebase organized with an opinionated component model and flexible dependency injection system
Angular components make it easy to split your code into well-encapsulated parts.

The versatile dependency injection helps you keep your code modular, loosely-coupled, and testable.

Get started with Components
Get fast state updates with fine-grained reactivity based on Signals
Our fine-grained reactivity model, combined with compile-time optimizations, simplifies development and helps build faster apps by default.

Granularly track how and where state is used throughout an application, giving the framework the power to render fast updates via highly optimized instructions.

Explore Angular Signals
Meet your performance targets with SSR, SSG, hydration, and next-generation deferred loading
Angular supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) along with full DOM hydration. defer blocks in templates make it simple to declaratively divide your templates into lazy-loadable parts.
